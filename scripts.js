        No Matter the Distance, My Thoughts Always Find You. ðŸ’«<br>
        To the One Who Stays Unknown to My Heart, or Perhaps the One Who Never Wanted to Beâ€¦ No Worries, I Understand.<br>
        Some Things Are Not Meant to Be Held, Only Admired from Afar. Just Know, Even From a Distance, My Heart Still Feels For You. ðŸ’–<br>
        I May Never Be Able to Tell You How Much Your Smile Brightens My Day or How Your Laugh Echoes in My Mind. But I Want You to Know, Even in My Silence, I Admire Everything About You.<br>
        There Are Moments When Words Can't Do Justice to How I Feel, But I Hope My Actions and Thoughts Can Speak for Me.<br>
        So Many Times, I've Wanted to Tell You What You Mean to Me, But There Are Things That Can't Be Said in Wordsâ€”Things That Only the Heart Can Understand.<br>
        And Even Though We Might Be Separated by Time and Space, Just Thinking About You Feels Like the Sun Breaking Through the Clouds, Lighting Up My Life.<br>
        You May Not Know This, But Your Presence in My Life Is Like a Light That Never Fades. I Donâ€™t Know What Tomorrow Holds, But I Know That My Thoughts Will Always Be With You, No Matter Where You Are.<br>
        Even If We Never Cross Paths in This Lifetime, Know That You Are In My Heart, Always. The Distance May Separate Us, But It Will Never Diminish the Care I Have for You. ðŸ’–
